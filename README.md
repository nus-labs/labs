# Laser Attack Benchmark Suite (LABS) (Alpha)

Laser fault injection is one of the most dangerous means to introduce faults into a target system. Attackers can exploit faults induced by lasers to, for example, retrieve confidential information from an AES cryptographic algorithm or degrade neural network performance.

We propose the Laser Attack Benchmark Suite (LABS) that tries to complete the security evaluation loop against laser fault injection by allowing early testing and automatic redundancy integration. 

The official website of the Laser Attack Benchmark Suite can be found in this website [https://nus-labs.github.io/](https://nus-labs.github.io/). 

Detailed information can be found in a ICCAD 2020 paper, [Laser Attack Benchmark Suite](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3400302.3415646), and the official website.
